# Human_facial_object_ditection

Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Edge Impulse to detect human facial objects such as the nose and eyes. Edge Impulse is a powerful platform for developing machine learning models for edge devices. This project includes data collection, model training, and deployment to an edge device.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Collection
Model Training
Model Deployment
Testing and Evaluation
Tools and Technologies
Edge Impulse: Platform for developing machine learning models.
Python: For preprocessing data and deploying the model.
Edge Device: Device to deploy and test the model (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
Data Collection
Collecting Facial Object Data
Setup Edge Impulse Project:

Create a new project on the Edge Impulse platform.
Define labels for the facial objects you want to detect (e.g., nose, left_eye, right_eye).
Capture Images:

Use the Edge Impulse mobile app or your deviceâ€™s camera to capture images containing the facial objects.
Ensure a variety of images with different angles, lighting conditions, and distances.
Upload Data:

Upload the collected images to the Edge Impulse project.
Label each image according to the facial object it contains.
Model Training
Training the Model
Create Impulse:

In the Edge Impulse dashboard, create an impulse by selecting the type of input data (images) and preprocessing steps (e.g., image resizing, grayscale conversion).
Feature Extraction:

Configure the feature extraction parameters to extract meaningful features from the images.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable model for object detection (e.g., MobileNetV2).
Configure the model parameters and start training.
Model Evaluation:

After training, evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.
Check metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Testing and Evaluation
Testing the Deployed Model
Real-time Testing:

Run the deployment script and test the model in real-time.
Verify the model's performance in detecting facial objects under different conditions.
Evaluation Metrics:

Measure the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using a separate test dataset or real-world scenarios.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Edge Impulse for developing a facial object detection model. The combination of Edge Impulse's machine learning capabilities and the flexibility of edge devices allows for efficient and accurate detection of facial objects in real-time.
